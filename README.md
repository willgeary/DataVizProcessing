# DataVizProcessing

This repository contains a few example Processing sketches.

`CitiBikeTrips` is by Juan Francisco Saldarriaga. You can see more from him here: https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/DataScienceSocietyWorkshop

`JellyFish` is a fun example of using random noise to generate pretty images (that look like jellyfish!).

`PieChart` is an example of an animated pie chart.



### p5.js

Additionally, here are some example sketches made with p5.js, which is a javascript library that uses the same philosophical framework as Processing.
